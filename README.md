## Intro
- I previously knew programming in **Python** and **C**. I have also written many [python scripts](https://github.com/abhishekmj303/Virtual-Assistant) to automate things in my computer.
- I had a basic knowledge of **Git** and **Github**, which I used in some projects.
- I had become full time **Linux** user since the beginning of 1st year.
- I had also learnt the working of **Docker** along with docker-compose files by hosting some OpenSource projects in my own server.
- Recently, I started learning **Bash Scripting** for linux and wrote a [installation script](https://github.com/abhishekmj303/LogiNetwork/blob/master/linux/install.sh) for one of my recent project.
